    <h2 style="margin-left: 690px; margin-right: 69x0px;">Why Us?</h2>
    <h3>I realised that though there are a wide range of products flooding the market, there were no good quality eco-friendly available at an affordable price,
         so I decided to take matters into my own hands and create GreenCrafts. At GreenCrafts, we assure good quality upcycled products at an affordable price for
        you or a friend; the office or your home. Whatever the case, we have products to suit your needs.</h3>
    <h3>We have three products presently on sale, with more to come soon!</h3>

    <br></br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(26, 177, 26);">Product one: The Denim Penstand</h3><h3>Denim is a tough material that can survive wear and tear better 
        than plastic. It is lighter than wood and 
        looks better than metal. This penstand uses good quality, upcycled denim to create a more asthetically pleasing, durable penstand. Price: ₹300 for 1.</h3>

    <br></br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(26, 177, 26);">Product two: Fake Rock</h3><h3>Rocks can be great for decoration but are often too cumbersome 
        or dangerous. Newspaper, when turned into a rock can have the same aesthetics and eliminate the disadvantages of an actual rock. This is perfect to gift
        to a friend at work or buy for you own home. Price: ₹70 for a box of 10.</h3>

    <br></br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(26, 177, 26);">Product three: Newspaper swan</h3><h3>Origami can often look 
        unprofessional or have low quality. However, our upcycled origami newspaper swan has both high quality upcycled materials, including 
        a wooden base, and pleasing aesthetics. Price: ₹110 for set.</h3><h3 style="color:rgb(16, 205, 193) ;">SALE! BUY A SWAN AND GET TWO OTHER SIZES FREE</h3>
